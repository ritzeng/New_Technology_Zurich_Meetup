This collection of materials is open to anyone. 

This collection of materials is provided while the Meetups held for / by the Zurich New ICT Technology Meetup.

About the Meetup:
https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Zurich-New-ICT-Technology-Meetup/

The topics are clear: new topics around new technology, engineering, IoT, cryptocurrency and ICT. 
These are not silos, but interconnected areas. We deal with these topics from the point of view of 
Start-ups and SMEs: what is needed, which experiences have been made, which financing possibilities 
exist and know how transfer. The results are possibly: better chances, formation of new teams, successful 
experiments, solid solutions and learning advantages. 

I would like to limit it 1st by the technological keywords: 
Arduino, ESP32, Pi, Bitcoin, IOTA, LoRa, iOS, Android, Web, Webservices, JSON, C++, Objective C, Java, 
JS, Swift, Phyton, Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA, Sensors, Actuators, decentralized systems.

We will have a short lecture on topics, discuss, experiment, exchange and take new experiences and 
results with you. The results are possibly: better chances, formation of new teams, successful experiments, 
better solutions and learning advantages. We're an independent group of managers, developers, designers, 
thinkers, makers, and idealists. We want to have fun experimenting technology, learning something new, 
experiencing, and sharing.

Note: depending on the participants, the language is English or German.
